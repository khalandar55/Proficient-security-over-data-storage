Hello there .

Welcome to my repository where you can secure your data in a cloud environment with multiple encryption techniques.


So? How does it Work?

Here you will not find any source code for the above mentioned security as we are storing all the data on cloud which is a service of AWS ( we are mainly concerned about AWS here) and the encryption technique which we use also is a service in AWS.

its just the data which the user wants to store and the encryption type the user wants .
